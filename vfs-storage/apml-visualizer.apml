project_overview:
  name: "APML Visualizer"
  description: "The tool that makes APML specifications visible and validatable"
  challenge: "Bootstrap paradox - need visualizer to validate APML, need APML to build visualizer"
  approach: "Build minimal viable visualizer first, then iterate using itself"

  app_to_app:
    - "Parse APML syntax into structured data"
