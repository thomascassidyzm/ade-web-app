# VISUALIZE Phase - User Experience Explanation

## What Will You See?

When you enter the VISUALIZE phase, you'll see a **three-panel workspace** that helps you design and understand your application. Think of it like having three specialized design tools side-by-side, each focusing on a different aspect of your app.

### The Three Panels

#### üì± Left Panel: Wireframe Designer
**What it looks like:** A drawing canvas with a grid background and tool buttons at the bottom.

**What you can do:**
- Draw rectangles, circles, lines, and add text to sketch your app screens
- Use the grid to keep everything aligned and professional-looking
- Save your wireframes, clear the canvas, or export your designs
- Elements automatically snap to the grid for clean layouts

**What happens when you use it:** As you draw wireframe elements, the system automatically creates corresponding flow nodes in the middle panel. It's like having a smart assistant that understands your design intent.

#### üîÑ Center Panel: User Flow Editor
**What it looks like:** A flowchart workspace where you can create and connect different types of boxes representing user actions.

**What you can do:**
- Add different types of nodes: start points, processes, decision points, and end points
- Connect nodes with smooth curved lines to show user paths
- Use the auto-layout button to organize your flow neatly
- Validate your flow to ensure all paths make sense

**What happens when you use it:** When you connect nodes, the system automatically adds corresponding steps to your user journey timeline in the right panel. Everything stays synchronized.

#### üó∫Ô∏è Right Panel: Journey Timeline
**What it looks like:** A vertical timeline showing the emotional journey users experience with your app.

**What you can do:**
- Add touchpoints (moments where users interact with your app)
- Track emotions at each step (happy, frustrated, confused, etc.)
- Export your journey map as a spreadsheet
- Navigate through different steps of the user experience

**What happens when you use it:** When you select a touchpoint, related wireframe elements light up in the left panel, helping you see the connection between user emotions and specific design elements.

## How the Panels Work Together

The magic happens in how these three panels **talk to each other**:

1. **Draw a button in the wireframe** ‚Üí A new process node automatically appears in the flow
2. **Connect two flow nodes** ‚Üí A new journey step gets added to the timeline
3. **Select a journey touchpoint** ‚Üí The related wireframe elements highlight

This means you never have to manually keep things in sync - the system does it for you.

## What Happens When You Click Things?

### Panel Interactions
- **Click on any element** ‚Üí Related elements in other panels light up with a pulsing animation
- **Drag the panel dividers** ‚Üí Resize panels to focus on what you're working on (minimum 200px width)
- **Click a panel header** ‚Üí That panel expands for focused work

### Mobile & Tablet Experience
- **On mobile:** The three panels become tabs you can swipe between
- **On tablet:** You see two panels at once, with a button to show/hide the third
- **On desktop:** All three panels are always visible

## Validation & Quality Control

The system helps ensure your designs make sense:

- **Wireframes:** Must have at least one element
- **User flows:** All nodes must be connected (no orphaned elements)
- **Journey maps:** Steps must follow a logical sequence

If something's wrong, you'll see helpful error messages guiding you to fix it.

## Saving & Exporting Your Work

Each panel lets you export your work in professional formats:
- **Wireframes:** SVG files for vector graphics
- **User flows:** JSON files for technical documentation
- **Journey maps:** CSV spreadsheets for analysis

## Behind the Scenes

The system automatically saves your work and keeps everything synchronized. All changes are validated in real-time, and the interface adapts to your screen size for optimal usability.

**Key principle:** Everything you create in one panel intelligently enhances the others, creating a comprehensive design system that thinks ahead for you.
