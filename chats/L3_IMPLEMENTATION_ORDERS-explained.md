- Does your implementation match the specification exactly?
- Are all required features present?
- Are there any unauthorized additions?

### **Mobile Responsive Testing**
- Does it work perfectly on phone screens?
- Are touch interactions optimized?
- Does it adapt to different screen sizes?

### **Data Synchronization Validation**
- Do all panels stay in sync?
- Do changes propagate correctly?
- Are events firing as expected?

### **Performance Benchmarks**
- Does it load in under 2 seconds?
- Are interactions responsive (under 100ms)?
- Is memory usage reasonable?

## Reporting Requirements

### **When you start work:**
- Report to L2_APML_MASTER that you're beginning the assignment
- Confirm you understand the requirements

### **When you complete work:**
- Report completion with evidence (screenshots, demo links, etc.)
- Provide test results showing quality gate compliance

### **If you encounter problems:**
- Report blockers immediately - don't wait
- Include specific details about the issue
- Suggest solutions if you have them

### **Daily progress:**
- Send daily status updates

3. **Test on mobile devices** frequently during development
4. **Document your work** for easier quality review
5. **Report progress regularly** to stay aligned with expectations
