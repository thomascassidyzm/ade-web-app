# Analyze Phase - Deep Dive User Guide

## What is the Analyze Phase?

The Analyze Phase is your project's starting point - think of it as your intelligent research assistant that helps you understand what you're building and why. It's colored in **cyan blue** üîç and focuses on turning your raw ideas into clear, actionable requirements.

## What You'll Experience

### The Four-Step Journey

#### 1. **Data Collection** - Tell us about your project
**What you'll see:** Input fields, file upload areas, and connection options
**What you'll do:**
- Type your project requirements directly
- Upload research files (.txt, .csv, .json files up to 5MB)
- Import data from websites by pasting URLs
- Connect to external APIs if you have them

**Validation:** The system ensures you provide at least 10 characters of meaningful input.

#### 2. **Data Processing** - We organize your information  
**What happens automatically:**
- Your input gets cleaned and structured
- The system recognizes patterns in your requirements
- Sentiment analysis determines user emotions and needs
- Everything gets categorized for easy understanding

**You'll see:** Progress indicators and real-time processing (takes less than 5 seconds)

#### 3. **Insight Generation** - AI-powered discoveries
**What the system finds:**
- **Patterns:** Recurring themes in your requirements
- **Trends:** Direction your project should take
- **Anomalies:** Unusual requirements that need special attention  
- **Recommendations:** Smart suggestions for your project

**You'll see:** Visual cards showing each insight with confidence levels and impact ratings

#### 4. **Requirement Definition** - Clear action items
**What you get:**
- Prioritized list of project requirements
- Acceptance criteria for each requirement
- Structured format ready for the design phase
- Export options for documentation

## Your Mobile Experience

### Screen Layout (Portrait phone)
- **Top section (80px):** Phase header showing "Analyze" with progress indicator
- **Scrollable middle:** Main workspace with all your tools and results
- **Bottom section (100px):** Action buttons (Save, Export, Continue to Design)

### What you'll see in the main area:

#### **Data Input Section**
- Large text area with placeholder: "Enter your requirements..."
- File upload button with drag-and-drop support
- URL input field for importing web content
- API connection setup (if needed)

#### **Data Visualization Section** 
- Charts showing your data breakdown (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, scatter plots)
- Visual representation of patterns and trends
- Interactive elements you can tap to explore

#### **Insights Panel**
- Cards displaying AI-generated insights
- Each insight shows:
  - Type (pattern/trend/anomaly/recommendation)
  - Description in plain English
  - Impact level (low/medium/high)
  - Confidence percentage

#### **Requirements Output**
- Clean, structured list of your project requirements
- Priority levels (high/medium/low)
- Acceptance criteria for each requirement
- Export button to save as documentation

## How Data Flows Through the Phase

1. **You input data** ‚Üí System validates it's complete and properly formatted
2. **Processing begins** ‚Üí Data gets cleaned, analyzed, and structured
3. **Insights emerge** ‚Üí AI algorithms find patterns and generate recommendations  
4. **Requirements form** ‚Üí Insights get transformed into actionable project requirements
5. **Ready for design** ‚Üí Your requirements become the foundation for the design phase

## Smart Interactions

### Multiple Ways to Input Data
- **Typing:** Direct text input with real-time character counting
- **File Upload:** Drag files directly onto the upload zone
- **URL Import:** Paste web links to import online content
- **API Integration:** Connect to external data sources with authentication

### Automated Processing
The system starts working as soon as you provide input:
- Real-time validation ensures data quality
- Background processing begins immediately
- Progress indicators keep you informed
- Results appear as soon as processing completes

### AI-Assisted Analysis
Smart algorithms work behind the scenes:
- Pattern detection finds recurring themes
- Trend analysis predicts project direction
- Anomaly detection flags unusual requirements
- Recommendation engine suggests improvements

## Validation & Quality Control

The system ensures quality at every step:

**Input validation:**
- Checks that you've provided meaningful content
- Verifies file formats are supported
- Validates URLs are accessible

**Insight validation:**
- Requires at least 3 actionable insights
- Ensures insights are relevant and specific
- Maintains confidence scoring for reliability

**Requirements validation:**
- Confirms requirements are actionable (not vague)
- Ensures proper prioritization
- Checks acceptance criteria are measurable

## Performance Expectations

- **Data processing:** Completes in under 5 seconds
- **Insight generation:** Finishes in under 10 seconds  
- **Page loading:** Loads in under 2 seconds
- **File uploads:** Processes immediately for supported formats

## Adaptive Screen Sizes

**Mobile phones:** Single column layout with vertical scrolling
**Tablets:** Two-column layout for faster workflow
**Desktop:** Three-column layout for maximum productivity

## Security & Privacy

Your data is protected with:
- AES-256 encryption for all sensitive information
- Input sanitization to prevent security issues
- Secure session management
- No data stored longer than necessary

## Moving Forward

Once you've completed analysis, the system automatically:
- Validates all requirements are defined
- Ensures insights meet quality standards
- Confirms data quality passes checks
- Enables progression to the Design phase

Your analysis results become the foundation for everything that follows - the design phase uses your requirements to guide wireframe creation, and the eye test phase uses your insights to evaluate design effectiveness.
